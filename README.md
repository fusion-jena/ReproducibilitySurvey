# Survey on Understanding Experiments and Research Practices for Reproducibility: Material and Results

This repository contains dataset and code for the analysis of the results from the survey 'Understanding Experiments and Research Practices for Reproducibility' conducted in the context of DFG CRC/TRR ReceptorLight. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of what is needed to achieve reproducibility of experiments in science. The survey was
implemented using [LimeSurvey](https://www.limesurvey.org/).
This repository provides 4 files:
1. Survey Questionnaire
2. Raw Data from LimeSurvey
3. Processed Data in  csv file format
4. Jupyter Notebook for data analysis
